# A simple login system using SQLite

## Features
The following features *currently* work:
* Sign-ups
* Log-ins
* Session variables are set([session variables set](#sessions-varialbes-set))
* Passwords updates
* Username updates
* Email updates
* Custom CSS
* Custom icon

The following features are *likely* going to be added soon:
* Password resets

## Setup:
Run in terminal:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NerdOfLinux/SQLite-Web-Login/master/index.php -O .ht.accountBackend.php
sqlite3 .ht.users.db
```
Then, run(with the `php` command or by visiting) the PHP file, and you should see:
```
Database file created
```
refresh, and the install should be complete!

## Wrapper
Having everything in one file is great in terms of ease of use. However, this does mean that updates will overwrite your changes. To get around this, more recent versions can accept existing variables. So, assuming you used the `wget` command above, a wrapper script(`account.php`) would look something like:
```php
<?php
$domain="your_domain_here";
$from_email="no-reply@your-domain-here";
$accountFile="account.php";
require(".ht.accountBackend.php");
?>
```
Now, whenever there is an update, simply run the following again:
```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NerdOfLinux/SQLite-Web-Login/master/index.php -O .ht.accountBackend.php
```
and all settings will **NOT** be affected as long as the wrapper script is not overwritten.

### Wrapper options
The following variables can be set:
* `domain` - this should be set to your site's full domain name
* `accountFile` - this should be set to the wrapper script's name(i.e. `account.php`)
* `from_email` - the address that emails are sent from(usually no-reply@your-domain)
* `siteName` - your site's name(appears in the headers)
* `customTitle` - your site's (shorter) name(appears in the tab title)
* `customCSS` - location to CSS file(must be accessible by PHP script)
* `customLogo` - location to a custom logo(not checked, be sure the filename is correct)

## Notes:

I build this using things such as:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES(\"$userName\", \"$email\", \"$password\")
```
so you're free to add additional columns without breaking anything(credits, registration date, etc.)

However, this is designed to be **just** a login system. For any other functionality such as comments, a forum, etc., please use another SQLite(or MySQL) database, and use the session variables for authentication. 

## Sessions varialbes set:
Upon successful login, the following variables are set:
* `loggedIn` is set to true
* `userName` is set to the username
* `id` is set to the rowid in sqlite, which is mainly used when updating user info
* `email` is set to the user's email

## SQLite is powerful enough for this
Many people will likely think that SQLite is too weak for use in a production website, well, it's not. According to the [SQLite appropriate uses](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html):

> SQLite works great as the database engine for most low to medium traffic websites (which is to say, most websites). The amount of web traffic that SQLite can handle depends on how heavily the website uses its database. Generally speaking, any site that gets fewer than 100K hits/day should work fine with SQLite. The 100K hits/day figure is a conservative estimate, not a hard upper bound. SQLite has been demonstrated to work with 10 times that amount of traffic.

> The SQLite website (https://www.sqlite.org/) uses SQLite itself, of course, and as of this writing (2015) it handles about 400K to 500K HTTP requests per day, about 15-20% of which are dynamic pages touching the database. Dynamic content uses about 200 SQL statements per webpage. This setup runs on a single VM that shares a physical server with 23 others and yet still keeps the load average below 0.1 most of the time.

So, unless your website is getting more than hundreds of thousands of daily requests, you're probably fine. 

Also, according to the [FAQs](https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q19):

> Actually, SQLite will easily do 50,000 or more INSERT statements per second on an average desktop computer.

Which means SQLite can handle hundreds to thousands of new users per second, which is very unlikely to get even on a popular website.

# This is NOT yet ready to be used on a real site
This is in alpha stages, and will likely have a ton of issues.
